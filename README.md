## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using Python: python car_sales_analysis.py

The script will load the car sales data, perform analysis, and display visualizations.
## Analysis Steps
Load the car sales data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Display basic dataset information including mean, standard deviation, and median of prices.
Calculate the number of unique car brands.
Compute statistics for numeric variables (price and mileage).
Count unique values and display value counts for categorical variables (car brand and fuel type).
Create a histogram of car prices.
Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between mileage and price.
Calculate the average price by car brand.
Create a bar chart to display the average price by car brand.
Feel free to modify the script and explore the data further.
